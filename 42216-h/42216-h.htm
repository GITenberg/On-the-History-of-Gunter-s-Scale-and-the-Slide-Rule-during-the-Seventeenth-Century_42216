<h2 id="c1">I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>In my history of the slide rule<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>, and my article on its invention<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>
it is shewn that William Oughtred and not Edmund Wingate is the
inventor, that Oughtred&rsquo;s circular rule was described in print in 1632,
his rectilinear rule in 1633. Richard Delamain is referred to as having
tried to appropriate the invention to himself<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> and as having written
a scurrilous pamphlet against Oughtred. All our information
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
about Delamain was taken from De Morgan,<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> who, however, gives no
evidence of having read any of Delamain&rsquo;s writings on the slide rule.
Through Dr. Arthur Hutchinson of Pembroke College, Cambridge, I learned
that Delamain&rsquo;s writings on the slide rule were available. In this
article will be given: First, some details of the changes introduced
during the seventeenth century in the design of Gunter&rsquo;s scale by
Edmund Wingate, Milbourn, Thomas Brown, John Brown and William Leybourn;
second, an account of Delamain&rsquo;s book of 1630 on the slide rule which antedates
Oughtred&rsquo;s first <i>publication</i> (though Oughtred&rsquo;s date of <i>invention</i> is earlier
than the date of Delamain&rsquo;s alleged invention) and of Delamain&rsquo;s later designs of
slide rules; third, an account of the controversy between Delamain and Oughtred;
fourth, an account of a later book on the slide rule written by William Oughtred,
and of other seventeenth century books on the slide rule.</p>
<h2 id="c2">II. INNOVATIONS IN GUNTER&rsquo;S SCALE</h2>
<h3 id="c3">Changes introduced by Wingate</h3>
<p>We begin with Anthony Wood&rsquo;s account of Wingate&rsquo;s introduction of Gunter&rsquo;s
scale into France.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1624 he transported into France the rule of proportion, having a little before been
invented by Edm. Gunter of Gresham Coll. and communicated it to most of the chiefest
mathematicians then residing in Paris: who apprehending the great benefit that might accrue
thereby, importun&rsquo;d him to express the use thereof in the French tongue. Which being performed
accordingly, he was advised by monsieur Alleawne the King&rsquo;s chief engineer to dedicate
his book to monsieur the King&rsquo;s only brother, since duke of Orleans. Nevertheless the said
work coming forth as an abortive (the publishing thereof being somewhat hastened, by reason
an advocate of Dijon in Burgundy began to print some uses thereof, which Wingate had in a
friendly way communicated to him) especially in regard Gunter himself had learnedly explained
its use in a far larger volume.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gunter&rsquo;s scale, which Wingate calls the &ldquo;rule of proportion,&rdquo; contained, as
described in the French edition of 1624, four lines: (1) A single line of numbers;
(2) a line of tangents; (3) a line of sines; (4) a line, one foot in length, divided into
12 inches and tenths of inches, also a line, one foot in length, divided into tenths
and hundredths.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>The English editions of this book which appeared in 1623 and 1628 are devoid
of interest. The editions of 1645 and 1658 contain an important innovation.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a>
In the preface the reasons why this instrument has not been used more are stated
to be: (1) the difficulty of drawing the lines with exactness, (2) the trouble of
working thereupon by reason (sometimes) of too large an extent of the compasses,
(3) the fact that the instrument is not readily portable. The drawing of Wingate&rsquo;s
arrangement of the scale in the editions of 1645 and 1658 is about 66 cm. (26.5 in.)
long. It contains five parallel lines, about 66 cm. long, each having the divisions
of one line marked on one side and of another line on the other side. Thus each
line carries two graduations: (1) A single logarithmic line of numbers; (2) a logarithmic
line of numbers thrice repeated; (3) the first scale repeated, but beginning
with the graduations which are near the middle of the first scale, so that its graduation
reads 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3; (4) a logarithmic line of numbers twice repeated;
(5) a logarithmic line of tangents; (6) a logarithmic line of sines; (7) the rule divided
into 1000 equal parts; (8) the scale of latitudes; (9) a line of inches and tenths of
inches; (10) a scale consisting of three kinds, viz., a gauge line, a line of chords,
and a foot measure, divided into 1000 equal parts.</p>
<p>Important are the first and second scales, by which cube root extraction was
possible &ldquo;by inspection only, without the aid of pen or compass;&rdquo; similarly the
third and fourth scales, for square roots. This innovation is due to Wingate.
The 1645 edition announces that the instrument was made in brass by Elias Allen,
and in wood by John Thompson and Anthony Thompson in Hosier Lane.</p>
<h3 id="c4">Changes introduced by Milbourn</h3>
<p>William Leybourn, in his <i>The Line of Proportion or Numbers, Commonly called
Gunter&rsquo;s Line, Made Easie</i>, London, 1673, says in his preface &ldquo;To the Reader:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Line of Proportion or Numbers, commonly called (by Artificers) Gunter&rsquo;s Line, hath
been discoursed of by several persons, and variously applied to divers uses; for when Mr.
Gunter had brought it from the Tables to a Line, and written some Uses thereof, Mr. Wingate
added divers Lines of several lengths, thereby to extract the Square or Cube Roots, without
doubling or trebling the distance of the Compasses: After him Mr. Milbourn, a Yorkshire
Gentleman, disposed it in a Serpentine or Spiral Line, thereby enlarging the divisions of the
Line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On pages 127 and 128 Leybourn adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Again, One T. Browne, a Maker of Mathematical Instruments, made it in a Serpentine
or Spiral Line, composed of divers Concentrick Circles, thereby to enlarg the divisions,
which was the contrivance of one Mr. Milburn a Yorkshire Gentleman, who writ thereof, and
communicated his Uses to the aforesaid Brown, who (since his death) attributed it to himself:
But whoever was the contriver of it, it is not without inconvenience; for it can in no wise be
made portable; and besides (instead of compasses) an opening Joynt with thirds [threads]
must be placed to move upon the Centre of the Instrument, without which no proportion
can be wrought.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>This Mr. Milburn is probably the person named in the diary of the antiquarian,
Elias Ashmole, on August 13 [1646?]; &ldquo;I bought of Mr. Milbourn all his Books
and Mathematical Instruments.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> Charles Hutton<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> says that Milburne of
Yorkshire designed the spiral form about 1650. This date is doubtless wrong,
for Thomas Browne who, according to Leybourn, got the spiral form of line from
Milbourn, is repeatedly mentioned by William Oughtred in his <i>Epistle</i><a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> printed
some time in 1632 or 1633. Oughtred does not mention Milbourn, and says
(page 4) that the spiral form &ldquo;was first hit upon by one Thomas Browne a Joyner,
. . . the serpentine revolution being but two true semicircles described on severall
centers.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></p>
<h3 id="c5">Changes introduced by Thomas Brown and John Brown</h3>
<p>Thomas Brown did not publish any description of his instrument, but his son,
John Brown, published in 1661 a small book,<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> in which he says (preface) that he
had done &ldquo;as Mr. Oughtred with Gunter&rsquo;s Rule, to a sliding and circular form;
and as my father Thomas Brown into a Serpentine form; or as Mr. Windgate in
his <i>Rule of Proportion</i>.&rdquo; He says also that &ldquo;this brief touch of the Serpentine-line
I made bold to assert, to see if I could draw out a performance of that promise,
that hath been so long unperformed by the promisers thereof.&rdquo; Accordingly in
Chapter XX he gives a description of the serpentine line, &ldquo;contrived in five (or
rather 15) turn.&rdquo; Whether this description, printed in 1661, exactly fits the instrument
as it was developed in 1632, we have no means of knowing. John Brown
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. First next the center is two circles divided one into 60, the other into 100 parts, for
the reducing of minutes to 100 parts, and the contrary.</p>
<p>2. You have in seven turnes two inpricks, and five in divisions, the first Radius of the
sines (or Tangents being neer the matter, alike to the first three degrees,) ending at 5 degrees
and 44 minutes.</p>
<p>3. Thirdly, you have in 5 turns the lines of numbers, sines, Tangents, in three margents
in divisions, and the line of versed sines in pricks, under the line of Tangents, according to
Mr. <i>Gunter&rsquo;s</i> cross-staff: the sines and Tangents beginning at 5 degrees, and 44 minutes where
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
the other ended, and proceeding to 90 in the sines, and 45 in the Tangents. And the line
of numbers beginning at 10, and proceeding to 100, being one entire Radius, and graduated
into as many divisions as the largeness of the instrument will admit, being 10 to 10 50 into
50 parts, and from 50 to 100 into 20 parts in one unit of increase, but the Tangents are divided
into single minutes from the beginning to the end, both in the first, second and third Radiusses,
and the sines into minutes; also from 30 minutes to 40 degrees, and from 40 to 60, into every
two minutes, and from 60 to 80 in every 5th minute, and from 80 to 85 every 10th, and the
rest as many as can be well discovered.</p>
<p>The versed sines are set after the manner of Mr. <i>Gunter&rsquo;s</i> Cross-staff, and divided into every
10th minutes beginning at 0, and proceeding to 156 going backwards under the line of Tangents.</p>
<p>4. Fourthly, beyond the Tangent of 45 in one single line, for one Turn is the secants to
51 degrees, being nothing else but the sines reitterated beyond 90.</p>
<p>5. Fifthly, you have the line of Tangents beyond 45, in 5 turnes to 85 degrees, whereby
all trouble of backward working is avoided.</p>
<p>6. Sixthly, you have in one circle the 180 degrees of a Semicircle, and also a line of natural
sines, for finding of differences in sines, for finding hour and Azimuth.</p>
<p>7. Seventhly, next the verge or outermost edge is a line of equal parts to get the Logarithm
of any number, or the Logarithm sine and Tangent of any ark or angle to four figures
besides the carracteristick.</p>
<p>8. Eightly and lastly, in the space place between the ending of the middle five turnes,
and one half of the circle are three prickt lines fitted for reduction. The uppermost being for
shillings, pence and farthings. The next for pounds, and ounces, and quarters of small
<i>Averdupoies</i> weight. The last for pounds, shillings and pence, and to be used thus: If you
would reduce 16s. 3d. 2q. to a decimal fraction, lay the hair or edge of one of the legs of the
index on 16. 3&frac12; in the line of 1. s. d. and the hair shall cut on the equal parts 81 16; and the
contrary, if you have a decimal fraction, and would reduce it to a proper fraction, the like
may you do for shillings, and pence, and pounds, and ounces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="center"><i>The uses of the lines follow.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As to the use of these lines, I shall in this place say but little, and that for two reasons.
First, because this instrument is so contrived, that the use is sooner learned then any other,
I speak as to the manner, and way of using it, because by means of first second and third
radiusses, in sines and Tangents, the work is always right on, one way or other, according to
the Canon whatsoever it be, in any book that treats of the Logarithms, as <i>Gunter</i>, <i>Wells</i>,
<i>Oughtred</i>, <i>Norwood</i>, or others, as in <i>Oughtred</i> from page 64 to 107.</p>
<p>Secondly, and more especially, because the more accurate, and large handling thereof is
more then promised, if not already performed by more abler pens, and a large manuscript
thereof by my <i>Sires</i> meanes, provided many years ago, though to this day not extant in print;
so for his sake I claiming my interest therein, make bold to present you with these few lines,
in order to the use of them: And first note,</p>
<p>1. Which soever of the two legs is set to the first term in the question, that I call the first
leg always, and the other being set to the second term, I call the second leg . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exact nature of the contrivance with the &ldquo;two legs&rdquo; is not described, but
it was probably a flat pair of compasses, attached to the metallic surface on which
the serpentine line was drawn. In that case the instrument was a slide rule,
rather than a form of Gunter&rsquo;s line. In his publication of 1661, as also in later
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
publications,<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> John Brown devoted more space to Gunter&rsquo;s scales, requiring the
use of a separate pair of compasses, than to slide rules.</p>
<h3 id="c6">Changes introduced by William Leybourn</h3>
<p>The same remark applies to William Leybourn who, after speaking of Seth
Partridge&rsquo;s slide rule, returns to forms of Gunter&rsquo;s scale, saying:<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is yet another way of disposing of this Line of Proportion, by having one Line of
the full length of the Ruler, and another Line of the same Radius broken in two parts between
3 and 4; so that in working your Compasses never go off of the Line: This is one of the best
contrivances, but here Compasses must be used. These are all the Contrivances that I have
hitherto seen of these Lines: That which I here speak of, and will shew how to use, is only
two Lines of one and the same Radius, being set upon a plain Ruler of any length (the larger
the better) having the beginning of one Line, at the end of the other, the divisions of each
Line being set so close together, that if you find any number upon one of the Lines, you may
easily see what number stands against it on the other Line. This is all the Variation. . . .</p>
<p><i>Example 1.</i> <i>If a Board be 1 Foot 64 parts broad, how much in length of that Board will make
a Foot Square?</i> Look upon one of your Lines (it matters not which) for 1 Foot 64 parts,
and right against it on the other Line you shall find 61; and so many parts of a Foot will make
a Foot square of that Board.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This contrivance solves the equation 1.64<i>x</i>=1, yielding centesimal parts of
a foot.</p>
<p>James Atkinson<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> speaks of &ldquo;Gunter&rsquo;s scale&rdquo; as &ldquo;usually of Boxwood . . .
commonly 2 ft. long, 1&frac12; inch broad&rdquo; and &ldquo;of two kinds: <i>long Gunter</i> or <i>single
Gunter</i>, and the <i>sliding Gunter</i>. It appears that during the seventeenth century
(and long after) the Gunter&rsquo;s scale was a rival of the slide rule.</p>
<h2 id="c7">III. RICHARD DELAMAIN&rsquo;S GRAMMELOGIA</h2>
<p>We begin with a brief statement of the relations between Oughtred and Delamain.
At one time Delamain, a teacher of mathematics in London, was assisted
by Oughtred in his mathematical studies. In 1630 Delamain published the
<i>Grammelogia</i>, a pamphlet describing a circular slide rule and its use. In 1631 he
published another tract, on the <i>Horizontall Quadrant</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> In 1632 appeared Oughtred&rsquo;s
<i>Circles of Proportion</i><a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> translated into English from Oughtred&rsquo;s Latin manuscript
by another pupil, William Forster, in the preface of which Forster makes
the charge (without naming Delamain) that &ldquo;another . . . went about to pre-ocupate&rdquo;
the new invention. This led to verbal disputes and to the publication
by Delamain of several additions to the <i>Grammelogia</i>, describing further designs
of circular slide rules and also stating his side of the bitter controversy, but without
giving the name of his antagonist. Oughtred&rsquo;s <i>Epistle</i> was published as a reply.
Each combatant accuses the other of stealing the invention of the circular slide
rule and the horizontal quadrant.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<h3 id="c8">Different editions or impressions</h3>
<p>There are at least five different editions, or impressions, of the <i>Grammelogia</i>
which we designate, for convenience, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Grammelogia I</i>, 1630. One copy in the Cambridge University Library.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></p>
<p><i>Grammelogia II</i>, I have not seen a copy of this.</p>
<p><i>Grammelogia III</i>, One copy in the Cambridge University Library.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a></p>
<p><i>Grammelogia IV</i>, One copy in the British Museum, another in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></p>
<p><i>Grammelogia V</i>, One copy in the British Museum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <i>Grammelogia I</i> the first three leaves and the last leaf are without pagination.
The first leaf contains the title-page; the second leaf, the dedication to the King
and the preface &ldquo;To the Reader;&rdquo; the third leaf, the description of the Mathematical
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
Ring. Then follow 22 numbered pages. Counting the unnumbered pages,
there are altogether 30 pages in the pamphlet. Only the first three leaves of this
pamphlet are omitted in <i>Grammelogia IV</i> and <i>V</i>.</p>
<p>In <i>Grammelogia III</i> the <i>Appendix</i> begins with a page numbered 52 and bears
the heading &ldquo;Conclusion;&rdquo; it ends with page 68, which contains the same two poems
on the mathematical ring that are given on the last page of <i>Grammelogia I</i> but
differs slightly in the spelling of some of the words. The 51 pages which must
originally have preceded page 52, we have not seen. The edition containing these
we have designated <i>Grammelogia II</i>. The reason for the omission of these 51
pages can only be conjectured. In Oughtred&rsquo;s <i>Epistle</i> (p. 24), it is stated that
Delamain had given a copy of the <i>Grammelogia</i> to Thomas Brown, and that two
days later Delamain asked for the return of the copy, &ldquo;because he had found
some things to be altered therein&rdquo; and &ldquo;rent out all the middle part.&rdquo; Delamain
labored &ldquo;to recall all the bookes he had given forth, (which were many) before the
sight of <i>Brownes Lines</i>.&rdquo; These spiral lines Oughtred claimed that Delamain
had stolen from Brown. The title-page and page 52 are the only parts of the
<i>Appendix</i>, as given in <i>Grammelogia III</i>, that are missing in the <i>Grammelogia IV</i>
and <i>V</i>.</p>
<p><i>Grammelogia IV</i> answers fully to the description of Delamain&rsquo;s pamphlet
contained in Oughtred&rsquo;s <i>Epistle</i>. It was brought out in 1632 or 1633, for what
appears to be the latest part of it contains a reference (page 99) to the <i>Grammelogia
I</i> (1630) as &ldquo;being now more then two yeares past.&rdquo; Moreover, it refers to Oughtred&rsquo;s
<i>Circles of Proportion</i>, 1632, and Oughtred&rsquo;s reply in the <i>Epistle</i> was bound
in the <i>Circles of Proportion</i> having the <i>Addition</i> of 1633. For convenience of
reference we number the two title-pages of <i>Grammelogia IV</i>, &ldquo;page (1)&rdquo; and
&ldquo;page (2),&rdquo; as is done by Oughtred in his <i>Epistle</i>. <i>Grammelogia IV</i> contains, then,
113 pages. The page numbers which we assign will be placed in parentheses, to
distinguish them from the page numbers which are <i>printed</i> in <i>Grammelogia IV</i>.
The pages (44)-(65) are the same as the pages 1-22, and the pages (68)-(83) are
the same as the pages 53-68. Thus only thirty-eight pages have page numbers
printed on them. The pages (67) and (83) are identical in wording, except for
some printer&rsquo;s errors; they contain verses in praise of the <i>Ring</i>, and have near the
bottom the word &ldquo;Finis.&rdquo; Also, pages (22) and (23) are together identical in
wording with page (113), which is set up in finer type, containing an advertisement
of a part of <i>Grammelogia IV</i> explaining the mode of graduating the circular
rules. There are altogether six parts of <i>Grammelogia IV</i> which begin or end by
an address to the reader, thus: &ldquo;To the Reader,&rdquo; &ldquo;Courteous Reader,&rdquo; or &ldquo;To
the courteous and benevolent Reader . . .,&rdquo; namely the pages (8), (22), (68), (89),
(90), (108). In his <i>Epistle</i> (page 2), Oughtred characterizes the make up of the
book in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In reading it . . . I met with such a patchery and confusion of disjoynted stuffe, that
I was striken with a new wonder, that any man should be so simple, as to shame himselfe to
the world with such a hotch-potch.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p><i>Grammelogia V</i> differs from <i>Grammelogia IV</i> in having only the
second title-page. The first title-page may have been torn off from the
copy I have seen. A second difference is that the page with the printed
numeral 22 in <i>Grammelogia IV</i> has after the word &ldquo;Finis&rdquo; the
following notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This instrument is made in Silver, or Brasse for the Pocket, or at any other bignesse,
over against Saint Clements Church without Temple Barre, by Elias Allen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This notice occurs also on page 22 of <i>Grammelogia I</i> and <i>III</i>, but is omitted from
page 22 of <i>Grammelogia V</i>.</p>
<h3 id="c9">Description of Delamain&rsquo;s instrument of 1630</h3>
<p>In his address to King Charles I, in his <i>Grammelogia I</i>, Delamain emphasizes
the ease of operating with his slide rule by stating that it is &ldquo;fit for use . . . as well
on Horse backe as on Foot.&rdquo; Speaking &ldquo;To the Reader,&rdquo; he states that he has
&ldquo;for many yeares taught the Mathematicks in this Towne,&rdquo; and made efforts to
improve Gunter&rsquo;s scale &ldquo;by some Motion, so that the whole body of Logarithmes
might move proportionally the one to the other, as occasion required. This
conceit in February last [1629] I struke upon, and so composed my <i>Grammelogia</i>
or <i>Mathematicall Ring</i>; by which only with an <i>ocular inspection</i>, there is had at
one instant all proportionalls through the said body of Numbers.&rdquo; He dates his
preface &ldquo;first of January, 1630.&rdquo; The fifth and sixth pages contain his &ldquo;Description
of the Grammelogia,&rdquo; the term <i>Grammelogia</i> being applied to the instrument,
as well as to the book. His description is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The parts of the Instrument are two Circles, the one moveable, and the other fixed; The
moveable is that unto which is fastened a small pin to move it by; the other Circle may be
conceived to be fixed; The circumference of the moveable Circle is divided into unequall
parts, charactered with figures thus, 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. these figures doe represent themselves,
or such numbers unto which a Cipher or Ciphers are added, and are varied as the occasion
falls out in <i>the speech of Numbers</i>, so 1. stands for 1. or 10. or 100., &amp;c. the 2. stands for
2. or 20. or 200. or 2000., &amp;c. the 3. stands for 30. or 300. or 3000., &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After elaborating this last point and explaining the decimal subdivisions on
the scales of the movable circle, he says that &ldquo;the numbers and divisions on the
fixed Circle, are the very same that the moveable are, . .&rdquo; There is no drawing
of the slide rule in this publication. The twenty-two numbered pages give explanations
of the various uses to which the instrument can be put: &ldquo;How to performe
the Golden Rule&rdquo; (pp. 1-3), &ldquo;Further uses of the Golden Rule&rdquo; (pp. 4-6),
&ldquo;Notions or Principles touching the disposing or ordering of the Numbers in the
Golden Rule in their true places upon the Grammelogia&rdquo; (pp. 7-11), &ldquo;How to
divide one number by another&rdquo; (pp. 12, 13), &ldquo;to multiply one Number by another&rdquo;
(pp. 14, 15), &ldquo;To find Numbers in continuall proportion&rdquo; (pp. 16, 17), &ldquo;How to
extract the Square Root,&rdquo; &ldquo;How to extract the Cubicke Root&rdquo; (pp. 18-21),
&ldquo;How to performe the Golden Rule&rdquo; (the rule of proportion) is explained thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seeke the first number in the moveable, and bring it to the second number in the fixed,
so right against the third number in the moveable, is the answer in the fixed.</p>
<p>If the Interest of 100. li. be 8. li. in the yeare, what is the Interest of 65. li. for the same time.</p>
<p>Bring 100. in the moveable to 8. in the fixed, so right against 65. in the moveable is 5.2.
in the fixed, and so much is the Interest of 65. li. for the yeare at 8. li. for 100. li. <i>per annum</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>The <i>Instrument</i> not removed, you may at one instant right against any summe of money
in the moveable, see the Interest thereof in the fixed: the reason of this is from the <i>Definition
of Logarithmes.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the earliest known printed instructions on the use of a slide rule.
It will be noticed that the description of the instrument at the opening makes no
references to logarithmic lines for the trigonometric functions; only the line of
numbers is given. Yet the title-page promised the &ldquo;resolution of Plaine and
Sphericall Triangles.&rdquo; Page 22 throws light upon this matter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there be composed three Circles of equal thicknesse, A.B.C. so that the inner edge of D
[should be B] and the outward edge of A bee answerably graduated with <i>Logarithmall signes</i>
[sines], and the outward edge of B and the inner edge of A with <i>Logarithmes</i>; and then on the
backside be graduated the <i>Logarithmall Tangents</i>, and againe the <i>Logarithmall signes</i> oppositly
to the former graduations, it shall be fitted for the resolution of <i>Plaine</i> and <i>Sphericall
Triangles</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After twelve lines of further remarks on this point he adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hence from the forme, I have called it a <i>Ring</i>, and <i>Grammelogia</i> by annoligie of a <i>Lineary
speech</i>; which <i>Ring</i>, if it were projected in the <i>convex</i> unto two yards <i>Diameter</i>, or thereabouts,
and the line <i>Decupled</i>, it would worke <i>Trigonometrie</i> unto seconds, and give <i>proportionall
numbers</i> unto six places only by an <i>ocular inspection</i>, which would compendiate <i>Astronomicall
calculations</i>, and be sufficient for the <i>Prosthaphaeresis</i> of the Motions: But of this as God shall
give life and ability to health and time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The unnumbered page following page 22 contains the patent and copyright
on the instrument and book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas Richard Delamain, Teacher of Mathematicks, hath presented vnto Vs an Instrument
called Grammelogia, or The Mathematicall Ring, together with a Booke so intituled,

</blockquote>
<h3 id="c10">Delamain&rsquo;s later designs, and directions for using his instruments</h3>
<p>In the <i>Appendix</i> of <i>Grammelogia III</i>, on page 52 is given a description of an
instrument promised near the end of <i>Grammelogia I</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That which I have formerly delivered hath been onely upon one of the
<i>Circles</i> of my <i>Ring</i>,
simply concerning <i>Arithmeticall Proportions</i>, I will by way of
<i>Conclusion</i> touch upon some uses
of the <i>Circles</i>, of <i>Logarithmall Sines</i>, and <i>Tangents</i>,
which are placed on the edge of both the
moveable and fixed <i>Circles</i> of the <i>Ring</i>
in respect of <i>Geometricall Proportions</i>, but first of the
description of these <i>Circles</i>.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, upon the side that the <i>Circle of Numbers</i> is one, are graduated on the edge of the
moveable, and also on the edge of the fixed the <i>Logarithmall Sines</i>, for if you bring 1. in the
moveable amongst the <i>Numbers</i> to 1. in the fixed, you may on the other edge of the moveable
and fixed see the <i>sines</i> noted thus 90. 90. 80. 80. 70. 70. 60. 60. &amp;c. unto 6.6. and each degree
subdivided, and then over the former divisions and figures 90. 90. 80. 80. 70. 70. &amp;c. you have
the other degrees, viz. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. each of those divided by small points.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, (if the <i>Ring</i> is great) neere the outward edge of this side of the fixed against the
<i>Numbers</i>, are the usuall divisions of a <i>Circle</i>, and the points of the <i>Compasse</i>: serving for observation
in <i>Astronomy</i>, or <i>Geometry</i>, and the sights belonging to those divisions, may be placed
on the moveable <i>Circle</i>.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>, opposite to those <i>Sines</i> on the other side are the <i>Logarithmall Tangents</i>, noted
alike both in the moveable and fixed thus 6.6.7.7.8.8.9.9.10.10.15.15.20.20. &amp;c. unto 45.45.
which numbers or divisions serve also for their <i>Complements</i> to 90. so 40 gr. stands for 50.
gr. 30. gr. for 60 gr. 20. gr. for 70. gr. &amp;c. each degree here both in the moveable and fixed is
also divided into parts. As for the degrees which are under 6. viz. 5.4.3.2.1. they are noted
with small figures over this divided <i>Circle</i> from 45.40.35.30.25. &amp;c. and each of those degrees
divided into parts by small points both in the moveable and fixed.</p>
<p><i>Fourthly</i>, on the other edge of the moveable on the same side is another graduation of
<i>Tangents</i>, like that formerly described. And opposite unto it, in the fixed is a Graduation
<i>of Logarithmall sines</i> in every thing answerable to the first descrition of Sines on the other side.</p>
<p><i>Fifthly</i>, on the edge of the <i>Ring</i> is graduated a parte of the <i>&AElig;quator</i>, numbered thus 10
20. 30. unto 100. and there unto is adjoyned the degrees of the <i>Meridian</i> inlarged, and numbered
thus 10 20.30 unto 70. each degree both of the <i>&AElig;quator</i>, and <i>Meridian</i> are subdivided into
parts; these two graduated <i>Circles</i> serve to resolve such <i>Questions</i> which concerne <i>Latitude</i>,
<i>Longitude</i>, <i>Rumb</i>, and <i>Distance</i>, in <i>Nauticall</i> operations.</p>
<p><i>Sixthly</i>, to the concave of the <i>Ring</i> may be added a <i>Circle</i> to be elevated or depressed for
any <i>Latitude</i>, representing the <i>&AElig;quator</i>, and so divided into houres and parts with an <i>Axis</i>,
to shew both the <i>houre</i>, and <i>Azimuth</i>, and within this <i>Circle</i> may be hanged a <i>Box</i>, and <i>Needle</i>
with a Socket for a <i>staffe</i> to slide into it, and this accommodated with <i>scrue pines</i> to fasten it
to the <i>Ring</i> and <i>staffe</i>, or to take it off at pleasure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pages bearing the printed numbers 53-68 in the <i>Grammelogia III</i>, <i>IV</i>
and <i>V</i> make no reference to the dispute with Oughtred and may, therefore, be
assumed to have been published before the appearance of Oughtred&rsquo;s <i>Circles of
Proportion</i>. On page 53, &ldquo;To the Reader,&rdquo; he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>. . . you may make use of the Projection of the <i>Circles</i> of the <i>Ring</i> upon a <i>Plaine</i>, having
the feet of a paire of <i>compasses</i> (but so that they be flat) to move on the <i>Center</i> of that <i>Plaine</i>,
and those feet to open and shut as a paire of <i>Compasses</i> . . . now if the feet bee opened to any
two termes or numbers in that <i>Projection</i>, then may you move the first foot to the third number,
and the other foot shall give the <i>Answer</i>; . . . it hath pleased some to make use of this way.
But in this there is a double labour in respect to that of the <i>Ring</i>, the one in fitting those feet
unto the numbers assigned, and the other by moving them about, in which a man can hardly
accommodate the <i>Instrument</i> with one hand, and expresse the <i>Proportionals</i> in writing with
the other. By the <i>Ring</i> you need not but bring one number to another, and right against
any other number is the <i>Answer</i> without any such motion. . . . upon that [the Ring] I write,
shewing some uses of those <i>Circles</i> amongst themselves, and conjoyned with others . . . in
<i>Astronomy</i>, <i>Horolographie</i>, in plaine <i>Triangles</i> applyed to <i>Dimensions</i>, <i>Navigation</i>, <i>Fortification</i>,
etc. . . . But before I come to <i>Construction</i>, I have thought it convenient by way
introduction, to examine the truth of the graduation of those <i>Circles</i> . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the words of a practical man, interested in the mechanical development
of his instrument. He considers not only questions of convenience but also
of accuracy. The instrument has, or may have now, also lines of sines and tangents.
To test the accuracy of the circles of Numbers, &ldquo;bring any number in the moveable
to halfe of that number in the fixed: so any number or part in the fixed shall give
his double in the moveable, and so may you trie of the thirds, fourths &amp;c. of numbers,
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
<i>vel contra</i>,&rdquo; (p. 54). On page 55 are given two small drawings, labelled,
&ldquo;A Type of the Ringe and Scheme of this Logarithmicall projection, the use followeth.
These Instruments are made in Silver or Brasse by John Allen neare
the Sauoy in the Strand.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c11">IV. CONTROVERSY BETWEEN OUGHTRED AND DELAMAIN ON THE INVENTION OF THE CIRCULAR SLIDE RULE</h3>
<p>Delamain&rsquo;s publication of 1630 on the &lsquo;Mathematicall Ring&rsquo; does not appear
at that time to have caused a rupture between him and Oughtred. When in 1631
Delamain brought out his <i>Horizontall Quadrant</i>, the invention of which Delamain
was afterwards charged to have stolen from Oughtred, Delamain was still in close
touch with Oughtred and was sending Oughtred in the Arundell House, London,
the sheets as they were printed. Oughtred&rsquo;s reference to this in his <i>Epistle</i> (p. 20)
written after the friendship was broken, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While he was printing his tractate of the Horizontall quadrant, although he could not but
know that it was injurious to me in respect of my free gift to Master <i>Allen</i>, and of <i>William
Forster</i>, whose translation of my rules was then about to come forth: yet such was my good
nature, and his shamelessnesse, that every day, as any sheet was printed, hee sent, or brought
the same to mee at my chamber in Arundell house to peruse which I lovingly and ingenuously
did, and gave him my judgment of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even after Forster&rsquo;s publication of Oughtred&rsquo;s <i>Circles of Proportion</i>, 1632,
Oughtred had a book, <i>A canon of Sines Tangents and Secants</i>, which he had borrowed
from Delamain and was then returning (<i>Epistle</i>, page (5)). The attacks
which Forster, in the preface to the <i>Circles of Proportion</i>, made upon Delamain
(though not naming Delamain) started the quarrel. Except for Forster and other
pupils of Oughtred who urged him on to castigate Delamain, the controversy might
never have arisen. Forster expressed himself in part as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>. . . being in the time of the long vacation 1630, in the Country, at the house of the Reverend,
and my most worthy friend, and Teacher, Mr. William Oughtred (to whose instruction I
owe both my initiation, and whole progresse in these Sciences.) I vpon occasion of speech
told him of a Ruler of Numbers, Sines, &amp; Tangents, which one had be-spoken to be made (such
as it vsually called Mr. Gunter&rsquo;s Ruler) 6 feet long, to be vsed with a payre of beame-compasses.
&ldquo;He answered that was a poore invention, and the performance very troublesome: But, said
he, seeing you are taken with such mechanicall wayes of Instruments, I will shew you what
deuises I have had by mee these many yeares.&rdquo; And first, hee brought to mee two Rulers
of that sort, to be vsed by applying one to the other, without any compasses: and after that
hee shewed mee those lines cast into a circle or Ring, with another moueable circle vpon it.
I seeing the great expeditenesse of both those wayes; but especially, of the latter, wherein it
farre excelleth any other Instrument which hath bin knowne; told him, I wondered that hee
could so many yeares conceale such vseful inuentions, not onely from the world, but from my
selfe, to whom in other parts and mysteries of Art, he had bin so liberall. He answered,
&ldquo;That the true way of Art is not by Instruments, but by Demonstration: and that it is a preposterous
course of vulgar Teachers, to begin with Instruments, and not with the Sciences,
and so in-stead of Artists, to make their Schollers only doers of tricks, and as it were Iuglers:

an Artist: but contemptible, being set and opposed to Art. And lastly, that he meant to
commend to me, the skill of Instruments, but first he would haue me well instructed in the
Sciences. He also shewed me many notes, and Rules for the vse of those circles, and of his
Horizontall Instrument, (which he had proiected about 30 yeares before) the most part written
in Latine. All which I obtained of him leaue to translate into English, and make publique,
for the vse, and benefit of such as were studious, and louers of these excellent Sciences.</p>
<p>Which thing while I with mature, and diligent care (as my occasions would give me leaue)
went about to doe: another to whom the Author in a louing confidence discouered this intent,
using more hast then good speed, went about to preocupate; of which vntimely birth, and
preuenting (if not circumuenting) forwardnesse, I say no more: but aduise the studious Reader,
onely so farre to trust, as he shal be sure doth agree to truth &amp; Art.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While in this dedication reference is made to a slide rule or &ldquo;ring&rdquo; with a &ldquo;moveable
circle,&rdquo; the instrument actually described in the <i>Circles of Proportion</i> consists
of fixed circles &ldquo;with an <i>index</i> to be opened after the manner of a paire of Compasses.&rdquo;
Delamain, as we have seen, had decided preference for the moveable
circle. To Oughtred, on the other hand, one design was about as good as the
other; he was more of a theorist and repeatedly expressed his contempt for mathematical
instruments. In his <i>Epistle</i> (page (25)), he says he had not &ldquo;the one halfe
of my intentions upon it&rdquo; (the rule in his book), nor one with a &ldquo;moveable circle
and a thread, but with an opening Index at the centre (if so be that bee cause
enough to make it to bee not the same, but another Instrument) for my part I
disclaime it: it may go seeke another Master: which for ought I know, will prove
to be <i>Elias Allen</i> himselfe: for at his request only I altered a little my rules from
the use of the moveable circle and the thread, to the two armes of an Index.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All parts of Delamain&rsquo;s <i>Grammelogia IV</i>, except pages 1-22 and 53-68 considered
above, were published after the <i>Circles of Proportion</i>, for they contain references
to the ill treatment that Delamain felt or made believe that he felt, that he had
received in the book published by Oughtred and Forster. Oughtred&rsquo;s reference
to teachers whose scholars are &ldquo;doers of tricks,&rdquo; &ldquo;Iuglers,&rdquo; and Forster&rsquo;s allusion
to &ldquo;another to whom the Author in a loving confidence&rdquo; explained the instrument
and who &ldquo;went about to preocupate&rdquo; it, are repeatedly mentioned. Delamain
says, (page (89)) that at first he did not intend to express himself in print, &ldquo;but
sought peace and my right by a private and friendly way.&rdquo; Oughtred&rsquo;s account
of Delamain&rsquo;s course is that of an &ldquo;ill-natured man&rdquo; with a &ldquo;virulent tongue,&rdquo;
&ldquo;sardonical laughter&rdquo; and &ldquo;malapert sawsiness.&rdquo; Contrasting Forster and
Delamain, he says that, of the former he &ldquo;had the very first moulding&rdquo; and made
him feel that &ldquo;the way of Art&rdquo; is &ldquo;by demonstration.&rdquo; But Delamain was
&ldquo;already corrupted with doing upon Instruments, and quite lost from ever being
made an Artist.&rdquo; (<i>Epistle</i> page (27)). Repeatedly does Oughtred assert Delamain&rsquo;s
ignorance of mathematics. The two men were evidently of wholly different
intellectual predilections. That Delamain loved instruments is quite
evident, and we proceed to describe his efforts to improve the circular slide rule.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>The <i>Grammelogia IV</i> is dedicated to King Charles I. Delamain says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>. . . Everything hath his beginning, and curious <i>Arts</i> seldome come to the height at the
first; It was my promise then to enlarge the <i>invention</i> by a way of <i>decuplating the Circles</i>,
which I now present unto your <i>sacred Majestie</i> as the <i>quintessence</i> and <i>excellencie</i> there of . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His enlarged circular rules are illustrated in the Bodleian Library copy of
<i>Grammelogia IV</i> by four diagrams, two of them being the two drawings on the two
title-pages at the beginning of the <i>Grammelogia IV</i>, 4 inches in external diameter,
and exhibiting eleven concentric circular lines carrying graduations of different
sorts. In the second of these designs all circles are fixed. The other two drawings
are each 10&frac34; inches in external diameter and exhibit 18 concentric circular lines;
the folded sheet of the first of these drawings is inserted between pages (23) and
(24), the second folded sheet between pages (83) and (84). All circles of this
second instrument are fixed. Counting in the two small drawings in <i>Grammelogia
III</i>, there are in all six drawings of slide rules in the Bodleian <i>Grammelogia IV</i>.
On pages (24) to (43) Delamain explains the graduation of slide rules. He takes
first a rule which has one circle of equal parts, divided into 1000 equal divisions.
From a table of logarithms he gets log 2 = 0.301; from the number 301 in the circle
of equal parts he draws a line to the center of the circle and marks the intersection
with the circles of numbers by the figure 2. Thus he proceeds with log 3, log 4,
and so on; also with log sin <i>x</i> and log tan <i>x</i>. For log sin <i>x</i> he
uses two circles, the first (see page (27)) for angles from
34&prime; 24&Prime; to 5&deg; 44&prime; 22&Prime;,
the second circle from
5&deg; 44&prime; 22&Prime; to 90&deg;. The drawings do not show the seconds. He suggests many
different designs of rules. On page (29) he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the single projection of the <i>Circles of my Ring</i>, and the dividing and graduating of
them: which may bee so inserted upon the edges of <i>Circles</i> of mettle turned in the forme of a
<i>Ring</i>, so that one <i>Circle</i> may moove betweene two fixed, by helpe of two stayes, then may
there be graduated on the <i>face of the Ring</i>, upon the outer edge of the mooveable and inner
edge of the fixed, the <i>Circle of Numbers</i>, then upon the inner edge of that mooveable <i>Circle</i>,
and the outward edge of that inner fixed Circle may be inserted the <i>Circle of Sines</i>, and so
according to the description of those that are usually made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to these lines he proceeds to mention the circle giving the ordinary
division into degrees and minutes, and two circles of tangents on the other side of
the rule.</p>
<p>Next Delamain explains an arrangement of all the graduation on one side of
the rule by means of &ldquo;a small channell in the innermost <i>fixed Circle</i>, in which may
be placed a small single Index, which may have sufficient length to reach from the
innermost edge of the <i>Mooveable Circle</i>, unto the outmost edge of the <i>fixed Circle</i>,
which may be mooved to and fro at pleasure, in the channell, which Index may
serve to shew the opposition of Numbers&rdquo; (p. (31)). From this it is clear that the
invention of the &ldquo;runner&rdquo; goes back to the very first writers on the slide rule.</p>
<p>After describing a modification of the above arrangement, he adds, &ldquo;many
other formes might be deliverd, about this single <i>projection</i>&rdquo; (p. (32)).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>Proceeding to the &ldquo;enlarging&rdquo; of the circles in the Ring, to, say, the &ldquo;<i>Quadruple</i>
to that which is single, that is, foure times greater,&rdquo; the &ldquo;equall parts&rdquo; are
distributed over four circles instead of only one circle, but the general method of
graduation is the same as before (p. (33)); there being now four circles carrying
the logarithms of numbers, and so on. Next he points out &ldquo;severall wayes how
the Circles of the Mathematicall Ring (being inlarged) may be accommodated
for practicall use:&rdquo; (1) The Circles are all fixed in a plain and movable flat
compasses (or better, a movable semicircle) are used for fixing any two positions;
(2) There is a &ldquo;double projection&rdquo; of each logarithmic line &ldquo;inlarged on a Plaine,&rdquo;
one fixed, the other movable, as shown in his first figure on the title-page, a single
index only being used; (3) use of &ldquo;my great <i>Cylinder</i> which I have long proposed
(in which all the Circles are of equall greatnesse,) and it may be made of any
magnitude or capacity, but for a study (hee that will be at the charge) it may be
of a yard diameter and of such an indifferent length that it may containe 100 or
more Circles fixed parallel one to the other on the <i>Cylinder</i>, having a space betweene
each of them, so that there may bee as many mooveable Circles, as there are fixed
ones, and these of the mooveable linked, or fastened together, so that they may
all moove together by the fixed ones in these spaces, whose edges both of the fixed,
and mooveable being graduated by helpe of a single Index will shew the proportionalls
by opposition in this double <i>Projection</i>, or by a double <i>Index</i> in a single <i>Projection</i>&rdquo;
(p. (36)).</p>
<p>Next follows the detailed description of his Ring &ldquo;on a Plaine, according to
the diagramme that was given the King (for a view of that projection) and afterwards
the Ring it selve.&rdquo; The diagram is the large one which we mentioned as
inserted between pages (23) and (24). The instrument has two circles, one moveable,
upon each of which are described 13 distinct circular graduations. The
lines on the fixed circle are: &ldquo;The Circle of degrees and calendar,&rdquo; E. &ldquo;Circle of
equall parts, and part of the Equator, and Meridian,&rdquo; TT. &ldquo;The Circle of Tangents,&rdquo;
S. &ldquo;The Circle of Sines,&rdquo; D. &ldquo;The Circle of Decimals,&rdquo; N. &ldquo;The
Circle of Numbers.&rdquo; The lines on the movable circle are: N. &ldquo;The Circle of Numbers,&rdquo;
E. &ldquo;The Circle of equated figures, and bodies,&rdquo; S. &ldquo;The Circle of Sines,&rdquo;
TT. &ldquo;The Circle of Tangents,&rdquo; Y. &ldquo;The Circle of time, yeares, and monethes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On pages (84)-(88) Delamain explains an enlargement of his Ring for computations
involving the sines of angles near to 90&deg;. On page (86) he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have continued the <i>Sines</i> of the <i>Projection</i> unto two severall <i>revolutions</i>, the one beginning
at 77.gr. 45.m. 6.s. and ends at 90.gr. (being the last <i>revolution</i> of the <i>decuplation</i> of the former,
or the hundred part of that <i>Projection</i>) the other beginning at 86.gr. 6.m. 48.s. and ends at
90.gr. (being the last of a ternary of <i>decuplated revolutions</i>, or the thousand part of that <i>Projection</i>)
and may bee thus used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He explains the manner of using these extra graduations. Thus he claims to have
attained degrees of accuracy which enabled him to do what &ldquo;some one&rdquo; had declared
&ldquo;could not bee done.&rdquo; It is hardly necessary to point out that Delamain&rsquo;s
<i>Grammelogia IV</i> suggests designs of slide rules which inventors two hundred or
more years later were endeavouring to produce. Which of Delamain&rsquo;s designs
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
of rules were actually made and used, he does not state explicitly. He refers to a
rule 18 inches in diameter as if it had been actually constructed (pages (86), (88)).
Oughtred showed no appreciation of such study in designing and ridiculed Delamain&rsquo;s
efforts, in his <i>Epistle</i>.</p>
<p>Additional elucidations of his designs of rules, along with explanations of the
relations of his work to that of Gunter and Napier, and sallies directed against
Oughtred and Forster, are contained on pages (8)-(21) of his <i>Grammelogia IV</i>.</p>
<h2 id="c12">V. INDEPENDENCE AND PRIORITY OF INVENTION</h2>
<p>The question of independence and priority of invention is discussed by Delamain
more specifically on pages (89)-(113); Oughtred devotes his entire <i>Epistle</i>
to it. It is difficult to determine definitely which publication is the later, Delamain&rsquo;s
<i>Grammelogia IV</i> or Oughtred&rsquo;s <i>Epistle</i>. Each seems to quote from the
other. Probably the explanation is that the two publications contain arguments
which were previously passed from one antagonist to the other by word of mouth
or by private letter. Oughtred refers in his <i>Epistle</i> (p. (12)) to a letter from Delamain.
We believe that the <i>Epistle</i> came after Delamain&rsquo;s <i>Grammelogia IV</i>.
Delamain claims for himself the invention of the circular slide rule. He says in
his <i>Grammelogia IV</i>. (p. (99)), &ldquo;when I had a sight of it, which was in <i>February</i>,
1629 (as I specified in my <i>Epistle</i>) I could not conceale it longer, envying my
selfe, that others did not tast of that which I found to carry with it so delightfull
and pleasant a goate [taste] . . .&rdquo; Delamain asserts (without proof) that Oughtred
&ldquo;never saw it as he now challengeth it to be his invention, untill it was so fitted
to his hand, and that he made all his practise on it after the publishing of my
<i>Booke</i> upon my <i>Ring</i>, and not before; so it was easie for him or some other to write
some uses of it in Latin after Christmas, 1630 and not the <i>Sommer</i> before, as is
falsely alledged by some one . . .&rdquo; (p. (91)). Delamain&rsquo;s accusation of theft on
the part of Oughtred cannot be seriously considered. Oughtred&rsquo;s reputation as a
mathematician and his standing in his community go against such a supposition.
Moreover, William Forster is a witness for Oughtred. The fact that Oughtred
had the mastery of the rectilinear slide rule as well, while Delamain in 1630 speaks
only of the circular rule, weighs in Oughtred&rsquo;s favour.</p>
<p>Oughtred says he invented the slide rule &ldquo;above twelve yeares agoe,&rdquo; that is,
about 1621, and &ldquo;I with mine owne hand made me two such Circles, which I have
used ever since, as my occasions required,&rdquo; (<i>Epistle</i> p. (22)). On the same page,
he describes his mode of discovery thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I found that it required many times too great a paire of Compasses [in using Gunter&rsquo;s
line], which would bee hard to open, apt to slip, and troublesome for use. I therefore first
devised to have another Ruler with the former: and so by setting and applying one to the other,
I did not onely take away the use of Compasses, but also make the worke much more easy
and expedite: when I should not at all need the motion of my hand, but onely the glancing
at my sight: and with one position of the Rulers, and view of mine eye, see not one onely,
but the manifold proportions incident unto the question intended. But yet this facility also
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
wanted not some difficulty especially in the line of tangents, when one arch was in the former
mediety of the quadrant, and the other in the latter: for in this case it was needful that either
one Ruler must bee as long againe as the other; or else that I must use an inversion of the Ruler,
and regression. By this consideration I first of all saw that if those lines upon both Rulers
were inflected into two circles, that of the tangents being in both doubled, and that those two
Circles should move one upon another; they with a small thread in the center to direct the
sight, would bee sufficient with incredible and wonderfull facility to worke all questions of
Trigonometry . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oughtred said that he had no desire to publish his invention, but in the vacation
of 1630 finally promised William Forster to let him bring out a translation. Oughtred
claims that Delamain got the invention from him at Alhallontide [November
1], 1630, when they met in London. The accounts of that meeting we proceed
to give in double column.</p>

reporteth) was the time he was <i>circumvented</i>,
and then <i>his intent in a loving manner (as
before) he opened unto me</i>, which particularly
I will dismantle in the very naked truth: for,
wee being walking together some few weekes
before <i>Christmas</i>, upon <i>Fishstreet hill</i>, we
discoursed upon sundry things <i>Mathematicall</i>,
both <i>Theoreticall</i> and Practicall, and of the
excellent inventions and helpes that in these
dayes were produced, amongst which I was
not a little taken with that of the <i>Logarythmes</i>,
commending greatly the ingenuitie
of Mr. Gunter in the <i>Projection</i>, and inventing
of his <i>Ruler</i>, in the lines of proportion, extracted
from these <i>Logarythmes</i> for ordinary
<i>Practicall uses</i>; He replyed unto me (in these
very words) What will yov say to an <i>Invention</i>
that I have, which in a lesse extent of the
<i>Compasses</i> shall worke truer then that of
Mr. <i>Gunters Ruler</i>, I asked him then of what
forme it was, he answered with some pause
(which no doubt argued his suspition of mee
that I might conceive it) that it was <i>Arching-wise</i>,
but now hee sayes that hee told mee
then, it was <i>Circular</i> (but were I put to my
oath to avoid the guilt of Conscience I
would conclude in the former.) At which
immediately I answered, I had the like my
selfe, and so we discoursed not a word more
touching that subject . . . Then after my
coming home I sent him a sight of my <i>Projection</i>

had not the <i>Invention</i> of my <i>Ring</i> before I
discoursed . . . it was not so facil for mee . . .

we walked together I told him what an Instrument
I had given to Master <i>Allen</i>, both
of the Logarithmes projected into circles,
which being lesse then one foot diameter
would performe as much as one of Master
<i>Gunters</i> Rulers of sixe feet long: and also of
the Prostaphaereses of the Plannets and
second motions. <i>Such an invention have I</i>
said he: for now his <i>intentions</i> (that is his

them: as upon his oath Master <i>Allen</i> will
testify how hee misled him, and made him

</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p class="clear">Oughtred makes a further statement (<i>Epistle</i>, p. (24)) as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Delamain hearing that Brown with his <i>Serpentine</i> had <i>another line</i> by which he could worke
to minutes in the 90 degree of sines . . . gave the [his] booke to Browne: who in thankfulnesse
could not but gratify Delamain with his <i>Lines</i> also: and teach him the use of them, but especially
of the <i>great Line</i>: with this caution on both sides, that one should not meddle with the
others invention. Two dayes after <i>Delamain</i> . . . because he had found some things to be
altered therin, . . . asked for the booke . . . but as soone as he had got it in his hands he rent
out all the middle part with the two Schemes &amp; put them up in his pocket &amp; went his way . . .
and . . . laboureth to recall all the bookes he had given forth . . . And shortly after this he
got a new Printer (who was ignorant of his former Schemes) to print him new: giving him an
especiall charge of the <i>outermost line newly graven</i> in the Plate, which indeed is <i>Brownes very
line</i>: and then altering his book . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This and other statements made by Oughtred seem damaging to Delamain&rsquo;s
reputation. But it is quite possible that Oughtred&rsquo;s guesses as to Delamain&rsquo;s
motives are wrong. Moreover, some of Oughtred&rsquo;s statements are not first hand
knowledge with him, but mere hearsay. One may accept his first hand facts and
still clear Delamain of wrong doing. There is always danger that rival claimants
of an invention or discovery will proceed on the assumption that no one else could
possibly have come independently upon the same devices that they themselves
did; the history of science proves the opposite. Seldom is an invention of any note
made by only one man. We do not feel competent to judge Delamain&rsquo;s case.
We know too little about him as a man. We incline to the opinion that the hypothesis
of independent invention is the most plausible. At any rate, Delamain
figures in the history of the slide rule as the publisher of the earliest book thereon
and as an enthusiastic and skillful designer of slide rules.</p>
<p>The effect of this controversy upon interested friends was probably small.
Doubtless few people read both sides. Oughtred says:<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> &ldquo;this scandall . . . hath
with them, to whom I am not knowne, wrought me much prejudice and disadvantage
. .&rdquo; Aubrey,<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> a friend of Oughtred, refers to Delamain &ldquo;who was so sawcy
to write against him&rdquo; and remembers having seen &ldquo;many yeares since, twenty or
more good verses made&rdquo; against Delamain. Another friend of Oughtred, William
Robinson, who had seen some of Delamain&rsquo;s publications, but not his <i>Grammelogia
IV</i>, wrote in a letter to Oughtred, shortly before the appearance of the latter&rsquo;s
<i>Epistle</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I cannot but wonder at the indiscretion of Rich. Delamain, who being conscious to himself
that he is but the pickpurse of another man&rsquo;s wit, would thus inconsiderately provoke
and awake a sleeping lion . . . he hath so weakly (though in my judgment, vaingloriously
enough) commended his own labour . . .<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Delamain presented King Charles I with one of his sun-dials, also with a manuscript
and, later, with a printed copy of his book of 1630. A drawing of his improved
slide rule was sent to the King and the <i>Grammelogia IV</i> is dedicated to him.
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
The King must have been favorably impressed, for Delamain was appointed tutor
to the King in mathematics. His widow petitioned the House of Lords in 1645
for relief; he had ten children.<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a></p>
<p>Anthony Wood states that Charles I, on the day of his execution, commanded
his friend Thomas Herbert &ldquo;to give his son the duke of York his large ring-sundial
of silver, a jewel his maj. much valued.&rdquo; Anthony Wood adds, &ldquo;it was invented
and made by Rich. Delamaine a very able mathematician, who projected it, and
in a little printed book did shew its excellent use in resolving many questions in
arithmetic and other rare operations to be wrought by it in the mathematics.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a></p>
<h2 id="c13">VI. OUGHTRED&rsquo;S GAUGING LINE, 1633</h2>
<p>It has not been generally known, hitherto, that Oughtred designed a rectilinear
slide rule for gauging and published a description thereof in 1633.<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> In his <i>Circles
of Proportion</i>, chapter IX, Oughtred had offered a closer approximation than that
of Gunter for the capacity of casks. The Gauger of London expostulated with
Oughtred for presuming to question anything that Gunter had written. The
ensuing discussion led to an invitation extended by the Company of Vintners to
the instrument maker Elias Allen to request Oughtred to design a gauging rod.<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a>
This he did, and Allen received an order for &ldquo;threescore&rdquo; instruments. On page
19 Oughtred describes his &lsquo;Gauging Rod:&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It consisteth of <i>two rulers of brasse</i> about 32 ynches of length, which also are halfe an ynch
broad, and a quarter of an ynch thick . . . At one end of both those rulers are <i>two little sockets</i>
of brasse fastened on strongly: by which the rulers are held together, and made to move one
upon another, and to bee drawne out unto any length, as occasion shall require: and when
you have them at the just length, there is upon one of the sockets <i>a long Scrue-pin</i> to scrue
them fast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are graduations on three sides of the rulers, one graduation being the logarithmic
line of numbers. He says (p. 39), &ldquo;the maner of computing the <i>Gauge-divisions</i>
I have concealed.&rdquo; W. Robinson, who was a friend of Oughtred, wrote
him as follows:<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>I have light upon your little book of artificial gauging, wherewith I am much taken, but
I want the rod, neither could I get a sight of one of them at the time, because Mr. Allen had
none left . . . I forgot to ask Mr. Allen the price of one of them, which if not much I would
have one of them.&rdquo; Oughtred annotated this passage thus: &ldquo;Or in wood, if any be made in
wood by Thompson or any other.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another of Oughtred&rsquo;s admirers, Sir Charles Cavendish, wrote, on February 11,
1635 thus:<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thank you for your little book, but especially for the way of calculating the divisions of
your gauging rod. I wish, both for their own sakes and yours, that the citizens were as capable
of the acuteness of this invention, as they are commonly greedy of gain, and then I
doubt not but they would give you a better recompense than I doubt now they will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On April 20, 1638, we find Oughtred giving Elias Allen directions<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> &ldquo;about
the making of the two rulers.&rdquo; As in 1633,<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> so now, Oughtred takes one ruler
longer than the other. This 1633 instrument was used also as &ldquo;a crosse-staffe to
take the height of the Sunne, or any Starre above the Horizon, and also their distances.&rdquo;
The longer ruler was called <i>staffe</i>, the shorter <i>transversarie</i>. While in
1633 he took the lengths of the two in the ratio &ldquo;almost 3 to 2,&rdquo; in 1638, he took
&ldquo;the transversary three quarters of the staff&rsquo;s length, . . . that the divisions may
be larger.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c14">VII. OTHER SEVENTEENTH CENTURY SLIDE RULES</h2>
<p>In my <i>History of the Slide Rule</i> I treat of Seth Partridge, Thomas Everard,
Henry Coggeshall, W. Hunt and Sir Isaac Newton.<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a> Of Partridge&rsquo;s <i>Double
Scale of Proportion</i>, London, I have examined a copy dated 1661, which is the
earliest date for this book that I have seen. As far as we know, 1661 is the earliest
date of publications on the slide rule, since Oughtred and Delamain. But it
would not be surprising if the intervening 28 years were found not so barren as
they seem at present. The 1661 and 1662 impressions of Partridge are identical,
except for the date on the title-page. William Leybourn, who printed Partridge&rsquo;s
book, speaks in high appreciation of it in his own book.<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a></p>
<p>In 1661 was published also John Brown&rsquo;s first book, <i>Description and Use of a
Joynt-Rule</i>, previously mentioned. In Chapter XVIII he describes the use of
&ldquo;Mr. Whites rule&rdquo; for the measuring of board and timber, round and square. He
calls this a &ldquo;sliding rule.&rdquo; The existence, in 1661, of a &ldquo;Whites rule&rdquo; indicates
activities in designing of which we know as yet very little. In his book of 1761,
previously quoted, Brown gives a drawing of &ldquo;White&rsquo;s sliding rule&rdquo; (p. 193);
also a special contrivance of his own, as indicated by him in these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A further improvement of the Triangular Quadrant, as I have made it several times, with
a sliding Cover on the in-side, when made hollow, to carry Ink, Pens, and Compasses; then
on the sliding Cover, and Edges, is put the Line of Numbers, according to Mr. White&rsquo;s first
Contrivance for manner of operation; but much augmented, and made easie, by John Brown.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>He gives no drawing of his &ldquo;triangular quadrant,&rdquo; hence his account of it is unsatisfactory.
He explains the use of &ldquo;gage-points.&rdquo; His placing logarithmic lines
on the edges of instrument boxes was outdone in oddity later by Everard who
placed them on tobacco-boxes.<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a> In Brown&rsquo;s publication of 1704 the White slide
rule is given again, &ldquo;being as neat and ready a way as ever was used.&rdquo; He tells
also of a &ldquo;glasier&rsquo;s sliding rule.&rdquo; William Leybourn explains in 1673 how Wingate&rsquo;s
double and triple lines for squaring and cubing, or square and cube root, can be
used on slide rules.<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a></p>
<p>Beginning early in the history of the slide rule, when Oughtred designed his
&ldquo;gauging rod,&rdquo; we notice the designing of rules intended for very special purposes.
Another such contrivance, which enjoyed long popularity, was the <i>Timber Measure
by a Line</i>, by Hen. Coggeshall, Gent., London, 1677, a booklet of 35 pages. Coggeshall
says in his preface:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For what can be more ready and easie, then having set twelve to the length, to see the
Content exactly against the Girt or Side of the Square. Whereas on Mr. Partridge&rsquo;s Scale
the Content is the Sixth Number, which is far more troublesome then [even] with Compasses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One line on Coggeshall&rsquo;s rule begins with 4 and extends to 40, these numbers being
the &ldquo;Girt&rdquo; (a quarter of the circumference), which in ordinary practice of measuring
round timber lies between 4 inches and 40 inches. This &ldquo;Girt line&rdquo; slides &ldquo;against
the line of Numbers in two Lengths, to which it is exactly equal.&rdquo; A second edition,
1682, shows some changes in the rule, as well as an enlargement and change of
title of the book itself: <i>A Treatise of Measures, by a Two-foot Rule</i>, by H. C. Gent,
London, 1682. In this, the description of the rule is given thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are four Lines on each flat of this Rule; two next the outward edges, which are
Lines of Measure; and two next the inward edges, which are Lines of Proportion. On one
flat, next the inward edges, is the Square-line [Girt-line in round timber measurement] with
the Line of Numbers his fellow. Next the outward, a Line of Inches divided into Halfs,
Quarters, and Half-Quarters; from 1 to 12 on one Rule; and from 12 to 24 on the other. On
the other flat, next the inward edges, is the double Scale of Numbers [for solving proportions].
Next the outward on one Rule a Line of Inches divided each into ten parts; and this for gauging,
etc. On the other a foot divided into 100 parts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later further changes were introduced in Coggeshall&rsquo;s rule.<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a></p>
<p>It is worthy of note that Coggeshall&rsquo;s slide rule book, <i>The Art of Practical
Measuring</i>, was reviewed in the <i>Acta eruditorum</i>, anno 1691, p. 473; hence Leupold&rsquo;s
description<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a> of the rectilinear slide rule in his <i>Theatrum arithmetico-geometricum</i>,
Leipzig, 1727, Cap. XIII, p. 71, is not the earliest reference to the rectilinear rule
found in German publications. The above date is earlier even than Biler&rsquo;s reference
to a circular slide rule in his <i>Descriptio instrumenti mathematici universalis</i>
of 1696.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Two noted slide rules for gauging were described by Tho. Everard,
Philomath, in his <i>Stereometry made easie</i>, London, 1684. He
designates his lines by the capital letters A, B, C, D, E. On the
first instrument, <i>A</i> on the rule, and <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>
on the slide, have each two radiuses of numbers, <i>D</i> has only
one, while <i>E</i> has three. The second rule is described in an
<i>Appendix</i>; it is one foot long, with two slides enabling
the rule to be extended to 3 feet.</p>
<p>Everard&rsquo;s instruments were made in London by Isaac Carver who, soon after,
himself wrote a sixteen-page <i>Description and Use of a New Sliding Rule, projected
from the Tables in the Gauger&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, London, 1687, which was &ldquo;printed for
William Hunt&rdquo; and bound in one volume with a book by Hunt, called <i>The Gauger&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>, London, 1687. This appears to be the same William Hunt who later
brought out descriptions of his own of slide rules. The instrument described by
Carver &ldquo;consists of three pieces, two whereof are moveable to be drawn out till
the whole be 36 inches long.&rdquo; It has several non-logarithmic graduations, together
with logarithmic lines marked A, B, C, D, of which A, B, C are &ldquo;double
lines,&rdquo; and D a &ldquo;single line&rdquo; used for squares and square roots. It is designed
for the determination of the vacuity of a &ldquo;spheroidal cask lying,&rdquo; a &ldquo;spheroidal
cask standing,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;parabolical cask lying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another seventeenth century writer on the slide rule is John Atkinson, whom we
have mentioned earlier. He says:<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> &ldquo;The Lines of Numbers, Sines and Tangents,
are set double, that is, one on each side, as the middle piece slides: which middle
piece is so contrived, to slip to and fro easily, to slide out, and to be put in any side
uppermost, in order to bring those Lines together (or against one another) most
proper for solving the Question, wrought by <i>Sliding-Gunter</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The data presented in this article show that, while the earliest
slide rules were of the circular type, the later slide rules of the
seventeenth century were of the rectilinear type.<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a></p>

is in the form of a brass disc, 1 ft. 6 in. in diameter. It was exhibited along with other instruments
in May, 1919. According to the <i>Catalogue of a Loan Exhibition of Early Scientific Instruments</i>
in Oxford, opened May 16, 1919, the instrument is inscribed with the name of the maker (&ldquo;<i>Elias
Allen fecit</i>&rdquo;) and with the name of the donor, Georgius Barkham. It is dated 1635, which is only
three years after the first publication of Oughtred&rsquo;s description of his circular slide rule. It
is stated in the <i>Catalogue</i>: &ldquo;Unfortunately all the movable parts but the base-plate and a couple
of thumb-screws are missing. The face of the instrument is engraved with Oughtred&rsquo;s <i>Horizontal
Instrument</i>. The back is engraved with eleven Circles of Proportion as described in Arthur
Haughton&rsquo;s book, a copy of which was presented to St. John&rsquo;s College by George Barkham, to
explain the use of the instrument.&rdquo; As Arthur Haughton&rsquo;s Oxford edition of Oughtred&rsquo;s <i>Circles
of Proportion</i> did not appear until 1660, it would seem that the instrument was probably not presented
to the College before 1660. As far as is known, the next oldest slide rule is of the year
1654, kept in the South Kensington Museum, London, and is described in <i>Nature</i> of March 5,
1914. It is a rectilinear rule, &ldquo;of boxwood, well made, and bound together with brass at the two
ends. It is of the square type, a little more than 2 ft. in length, and bears the logarithmic lines
first described by Edmund Gunter. Of these, the <i>num</i>, <i>sin</i> and <i>tan</i> lines are arranged in pairs,
identical and contiguous, one line in each pair being on the fixed part, and the other on the slide.&rdquo;
The instrument is inscribed, &ldquo;Made by Robert Bissaker for T. W., 1654.&rdquo; Nowhere else have
we seen reference to Robert Bissaker. His slide rule seems to antedate the &ldquo;Whites rule&rdquo;
mentioned above. [This foot-note was added on October 15, 1919.]

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
